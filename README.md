# Brain-CTscan-PretrainedCNNs

---

This project focuses on the detection of **acute intracranial hemorrhage (ICH)** and its subtypes from brain CT scan images using **pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs)**, including ResNet50, VGG16, Inception V3, Xception, and DenseNet121.

The study utilizes medical imaging data from the **RSNA Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection** dataset and applies deep learning–based image classification techniques to support early stroke detection and clinical decision-making.

CT windowing and preprocessing techniques are applied to enhance clinically relevant features.
